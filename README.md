## 📋 Overview
- Collected and processed open StatsBomb data for both tournaments.
- Built an **interactive dashboard** to visualize passing networks, shot maps, and heatmaps.
- Applied **PCA and K-Means clustering** to identify distinct team play styles.
- Compared tournament-level patterns to detect tactical evolution.
- Delivered analytical reports and insights on team efficiency, pressing intensity, and style clusters.

## 🧠 Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Loaded and cleaned StatsBomb JSON event data (passes, shots, pressures, etc.).
   - Engineered features such as possession value, pass accuracy, and field zones.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Created visual comparisons of passing networks and shot density by team.
   - Generated interactive plots (Plotly, mplsoccer) for dynamic exploration.
3. **Clustering & Dimensionality Reduction**
   - Used **PCA** to reduce feature space and **K-Means** to group teams by tactical style.
   - Visualized clusters showing high-press vs. possession-based teams.
4. **Dashboard Visualization**
   - Built a dashboard integrating visuals and metrics for team-level insights.

## 📈 Key Findings
- Identified **three major team clusters**: possession-oriented, counter-attacking, and balanced styles.  
- **2022 World Cup** showed a trend toward higher passing efficiency and compact defensive structures.  
- Visualization dashboards effectively reveal tactical evolution across tournaments.
